        <p> Understanding the structure of HTML documents  attributes, and elements, was overwhelming. I struggled to grasp how to properly nest elements and ensure my code was semantically correct. Simple errors, like forgetting a closing tag, often led to frustrating results that seemed to undermine my efforts. Debugging became a significant challenge. I found myself spending hours trying to pinpoint mistakes that caused my pages to display incorrectly. Each misstep felt like a setback, and I often questioned whether I would ever fully grasp the language. I recognize that every struggle has been a learning opportunity. While it’s hard to admit, HTML has tested my patience and problem-solving skills. I have learned the importance of attention to detail and persistence. With time, I am starting to see improvement, but the road ahead still feels daunting.
